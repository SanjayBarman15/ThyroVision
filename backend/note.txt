  Example: patients table
ALTER TABLE patients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

Policy: doctor can only see their own patients
CREATE POLICY "Doctor sees own patients"
ON patients
FOR SELECT
USING (doctor_id = auth.uid());

Insert policy
CREATE POLICY "Doctor inserts own patients"
ON patients
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (doctor_id = auth.uid());

Storage policy (Supabase SQL)
CREATE POLICY "Doctors upload own images"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'ultrasound-images'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);


🔐 Step 6: Separate ML / training access
Tables ML team owns (NO frontend access):

training_labels

model_versions

inference_logs

🔒 RLS:

ALTER TABLE training_labels ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Only service role"
ON training_labels
FOR ALL
USING (false);


➡️ Only backend (service role) can insert/export.
